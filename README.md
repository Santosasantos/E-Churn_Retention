## Introduction
The E-Churn_Retention project is designed to help B2B companies reduce customer churn rates and improve customer retention. By building an accurate churn prediction model and implementing personalized retention strategies, businesses can proactively address customer churn and enhance customer loyalty.

This repository contains the source code, dataset information, and relevant resources for the project.

## Features
- Customer churn prediction using machine learning algorithms
- Identification of key factors influencing churn and customer satisfaction
- Formulation and implementation of personalized retention strategies
- Evaluation of churn reduction and customer satisfaction improvement

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Santosasantos/E-Churn_Retention.git`
2. Run the html file

## Usage
1. Run the deployable model tool
2. Input the necessary information about customer
3. Hit the 'Predict' button
4. It will show you the if the customer is going to churn or not and also tell you the retention strategies

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical customer data, including demographics, transaction history, customer interactions, and satisfaction metrics. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset used in this repository is a simulated or anonymized version.

## Methodology
The project follows a data-driven approach and utilizes machine learning algorithms for churn prediction. The methodology involves:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model development using appropriate machine learning techniques
- Feature importance analysis to identify key factors influencing churn
- Formulation of personalized retention strategies based on model insights
- Implementation and monitoring of the retention initiatives

For a detailed description of the methodology and code implementation, please refer to the `methodology/README.md` file.

## Evaluation
The success of the project is evaluated based on:
- Churn prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Reduction in churn rate and improvement in customer retention rate
- Increase in customer lifetime value and customer satisfaction metrics
